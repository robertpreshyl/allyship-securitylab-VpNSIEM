# NetBird Self-Hosted Instance Front-End Development Prompt

Create a modern, responsive one-page front-end website for a self-hosted NetBird instance at netbird.allyshipglobal.com. This is not the official NetBird.io site but a custom front-end for a personal cybersecurity lab implementation.

## üéØ Primary Goals

- Professional appearance that reflects cybersecurity expertise
- Simple navigation to the NetBird login/signup interface
- Showcase this as part of a cybersecurity portfolio
- Mobile-responsive design that works on all devices

## üìê Design Requirements

**Style inspiration:** Take visual cues from netbird.io but make it clear this is a personal implementation

**Color scheme:**
- Primary: Dark blue (#0F172A) with cyber accents (teal #0D9488 or purple #8B5CF6)
- Secondary: Dark mode friendly with proper contrast
- Avoid using NetBird's exact color scheme to prevent trademark issues

**Typography:** Clean, modern sans-serif (Inter, SF Pro, or system fonts)
**Layout:** Single-page with smooth scrolling navigation
