### 🔗 **Network Design**

- **Self-hosted NetBird management server** on AWS VPS Ubuntu 22.04
- **Secure WireGuard tunnels** connecting:
  - Security Onion SIEM (local Oracle Linux 9 deployment)
  - Azure Sentinel (cloud-based SIEM for cross-validation)
  - Multiple honeypots (local + cloud-based)
  - Elastic Fleet Agents on 15+ endpoints for EDR

### 📊 **Log Collection Strategy**

#### Enterprise-Grade Log Ingestion via Elastic Fleet Agents
- **Deployed Elastic Agents** on 15+ endpoints (local VMs, cloud honeypots, RDPs/VPS)
- **Zero-trust telemetry flow** over NetBird VPN (no public-facing ports)
- **Complete log visibility** across hybrid environments (on-prem + cloud)
- **Eliminated custom scripting** with Elastic fleet's secure, scalable agent model

### 💡 **Key Security Insights**

> **Open SSH/RDP ports are magnets for automated attacks. Within hours of exposing services, thousands of brute-force attempts from diverse global sources were detected.**

- **95% of attacks are automated scanning bots**
- **Three IPs accounted for 25% of all attacks** in our honeypot
- **Services like RDP should never be exposed directly to the internet**
- **NetBird provides secure access without exposing attack surfaces**

## 💡 **Key Takeaway for Security Teams**

> **"Don't just collect logs — own the pipeline."**

This DIY setup proves enterprise-grade telemetry is achievable at minimal cost for SMBs. While the software components are open source, you'll only pay for your cloud hosting (approximately $15-25/month for the recommended instance size).
