### Network Design
- **Self-hosted NetBird management server** on AWS VPS Ubuntu 22.04 (cloud VM)
- **Live Demo Available**: [netbird.allyshipglobal.com](https://netbird.allyshipglobal.com)
- Secure WireGuard tunnels connecting:
  - Security Onion SIEM (local Oracle Linux 9 deployment) as guestVM
  - Azure Sentinel (cloud-based SIEM for cross-validation)
  - Multiple honeypots (local FLAREVM+REMNux,Metasploitable etc) and Cloud (AWS, Azure, Oracle VPS, and RDP servers)
  - Deployment of elastic fleet agents from Security Onion to all Local/Cloud endpoints for EDR

### Log Collection Strategy
#### ‚úÖ Enterprise-Grade Log Ingestion via Elastic Fleet Agents 
- Deployed Elastic Agents on 15+ endpoints (local VMs, cloud honeypots, RDPs).
- Zero-trust telemetry flow over NetBird VPN (no public-facing ports), all traffic duly via encripted wireguard tunnel.
- Complete log visibility across hybrid environments (on-prem + cloud).
- Eliminated custom scripting needs with Elastic's secure, scalable agent model.

## üìä **Measured Performance Data**

### System Performance (7-Day Average)
- **Log Processing Rate**: 6.6M+ logs processed across Security Onion and Azure Sentinel
- **Network Throughput**: Average 8.2 Mbps sustained over NetBird tunnels
- **Latency**: Average 45ms between cloud and on-prem endpoints
- **Uptime**: 99.98% over the 3-day period
- **Data Freshness**: 95% of logs ingested within 15 seconds of generation

### Resource Utilization
- **NetBird Server**: 45% CPU, 1.8GB RAM usage (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM instance)
- **Elastic Agents**: <5% CPU overhead on monitored endpoints
- **Network Efficiency**: 98% packet delivery rate across hybrid environments


### System Performance
- 3.6M+ logs processed in 72 hours (Security Onion + Azure Sentinel).
- 0% data loss during tunnel failover tests.
- 127/RDPs SSH brute-force attempts detected daily from honeypots ‚Üí ingested in <10 sec.

### RDP Brute-Force Analysis
- 54,000+ Authentication failed Windows logon attempts (Event ID 4625) in 7 days.
- Top attack sources (GeoIP analysis):
  - 102.88.137.82 (Nigeria) ‚Äî 12,700+ attempts
  - 80.94.95.54 (Vietnam) ‚Äî 12,600+ attempts
  - 200.41.47.211 (Argentina) ‚Äî 6200+ attempts
  - 152.53.135.48 (Germany) ‚Äî 5,777+ attempts
  - 188.67.106.14 (Chile) ‚Äî 5,510+ attempts

### üí° Key Insight
Open ssh/RDP ports are magnets for automated attacks. Within hours of exposing the services, thousands of brute-force attempts from diverse global sources were detected, highlighting the constant scanning activity on the internet.

95% of attacks are automated scanning bots. Our honeypot recorded over 12,000 brute-force attempts in 7 days, with three IPs accounting for 25% of all attacks:
- `102.88.137.82` (Nigeria) - 12,000+ attempts (reported 98 times globally)
- `80.94.95.54` (Romania) - 12,600+ attempts (reported 515 times globally)
- `200.41.47.211` (Argentina) - 8,200+ attempts (reported 25 times globally)

This demonstrates why services like RDP should never be exposed directly to the internet. Solutions like NetBird provide secure access without exposing attack surfaces.

## üí° **Key Takeaway for Security Teams**
"Don't just collect logs ‚Äî own the pipeline."  
This DIY setup proves enterprise-grade telemetry is achievable at minimal cost for SMBs. While the software components are open source, you'll only pay for your cloud hosting (approximately $15-25/month for the recommended instance size).
