## üîí Secure Cloud-Local Log Aggregation with Self-Hosted NetBird
A privacy-first solution for aggregating over 2,0000,000+ daily logs into locally Hosted Security Onion/Azure Sentinel - local/cloud EDR.

- **Enterprise Problem**: Fragmented cloud/on-prem logging cripples threat detection & intrustion prevention. Commercial solutions cost $15k+/month.
- **My Solution**: Self-hosted NetBird (WireGuard-based) ‚Äî $0 cost, full data ownership, 40% faster log ingestion.

### üìä Tailscale vs NetBird
| Metric | Tailscale (Managed) | NetBird (Self-Hosted) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Log ingestion speed | 12.3 logs/sec | 17.2 logs/sec (+40%) |
| Data ownership | ‚ùå Third-party egress | ‚úÖ Full control |
| AD integration | Limited | ‚úÖ Native support |
| Cost (for 50 nodes) | Over $299/month depends on scale | $0 |

## ‚úÖ Key Advantages of Self-Hosted NetBird in SIEM-Lab

### Operational Benefits
- **No vendor lock-in**: Full control over the entire infrastructure
- **Predictable costs**: Only pay for cloud hosting (~$15-25/month)
- **Customizable security policies**(AD): Implement granular access controls
- **No data egress fees**: All traffic stays within your controlled network

### Security Benefits
- **Reduced attack surface**: No public-facing management interfaces
- **Complete audit trail**: Full visibility into all network connections
- **Integration flexibility**: Easy integration with existing SIEM and monitoring tools
- **Zero-trust implementation**: Every connection is authenticated and encrypted

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture Overview

### Network Design
- Self-hosted NetBird management server on AWS VPS Ubuntu 22.04 (cloud VM).
- Secure WireGuard tunnels connecting:
  - Security Onion SIEM (local Oracle Linux 9 deployment) as guestVM
  - Azure Sentinel (cloud-based SIEM for cross-validation)
  - Multiple honeypots (local FLAREVM+REMNux,Metasploitable etc) and Cloud (AWS, Azure, Oracle VPS, and RDP servers)
  - Deployment of elastic fleet agents from Security Onion to all Local/Cloud endpoints for EDR

### Log Collection Strategy
#### ‚úÖ Enterprise-Grade Log Ingestion via Elastic Fleet Agents 
- Deployed Elastic Agents on 15+ endpoints (local VMs, cloud honeypots, RDPs).
- Zero-trust telemetry flow over NetBird VPN (no public-facing ports), all traffic duly via encripted wireguard tunnel.
- Complete log visibility across hybrid environments (on-prem + cloud).
- Eliminated custom scripting needs with Elastic's secure, scalable agent model.

## üìä Measured Performance Data

### System Performance (3-Day Average)
- **Log Processing Rate**: 3.6M+ logs processed across Security Onion and Azure Sentinel
- **Network Throughput**: Average 8.2 Mbps sustained over NetBird tunnels
- **Latency**: Average 45ms between cloud and on-prem endpoints
- **Uptime**: 99.98% over the 3-day period
- **Data Freshness**: 95% of logs ingested within 15 seconds of generation

### Resource Utilization
- **NetBird Server**: 45% CPU, 1.8GB RAM usage (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM instance)
- **Elastic Agents**: <5% CPU overhead on monitored endpoints
- **Network Efficiency**: 98% packet delivery rate across hybrid environments


### System Performance
- 3.6M+ logs processed in 72 hours (Security Onion + Azure Sentinel).
- 0% data loss during tunnel failover tests.
- 127/RDPs SSH brute-force attempts detected daily from honeypots ‚Üí ingested in <10 sec.

## üî• Real-World Attack Data (Production)
My internet-facing honeypots are actively targeted by real attackers ‚Äî proving the need for secure, reliable log aggregation.

### RDP Brute-Force Analysis
- 54,000+ Authentication failed Windows logon attempts (Event ID 4625) in 7 days.
- Top attack sources (GeoIP analysis):
  - 102.88.137.82 (Nigeria) ‚Äî 12,700+ attempts
  - 80.94.95.54 (Vietnam) ‚Äî 12,600+ attempts
  - 200.41.47.211 (Argentina) ‚Äî 6200+ attempts
  - 152.53.135.48 (Germany) ‚Äî 5,777+ attempts
  - 188.67.106.14 (Chile) ‚Äî 5,510+ attempts

### üí° Key Insight
Open ssh/RDP ports are magnets for automated attacks. Within hours of exposing the services, thousands of brute-force attempts from diverse global sources were detected, highlighting the constant scanning activity on the internet.

95% of attacks are automated scanning bots. Our honeypot recorded over 12,000 brute-force attempts in 7 days, with three IPs accounting for 25% of all attacks:
- `102.88.137.82` (Nigeria) - 12,000+ attempts (reported 98 times globally)
- `80.94.95.54` (Romania) - 12,600+ attempts (reported 515 times globally)
- `200.41.47.211` (Argentina) - 8,200+ attempts (reported 25 times globally)

This demonstrates why services like RDP should never be exposed directly to the internet. Solutions like NetBird provide secure access without exposing attack surfaces.

## üí° Key Takeaway for Security Teams
"Don't just collect logs ‚Äî own the pipeline."  
This DIY setup proves enterprise-grade telemetry is achievable at minimal cost for SMBs. While the software components are open source, you'll only pay for your cloud hosting (approximately $15-25/month for the recommended instance size).
